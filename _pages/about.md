I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering from [Brown University](http://www.brown.edu), where I was a member of Fluids and Thermal Sciences Group under the guidance of [Prof. Jesse Ault](https://sites.brown.edu/aultlab/). I was a Research Scientist Intern at [Tokyo Electron Limited](https://www.tel.com/) working on multiphysics simulation for single wafer wet etching processes. Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Iowa. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Rice University under the guidance of [Prof. Yong Lin Kong](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/yong-lin-kong) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

My research interests spans the theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of multi-physics transport processes with applications to soft matter, additive manufacturing, biomedical engineering, semiconductor manufacturing, and fluid dynamics. My research topics includes: Thermo-fluidic multi-physics phenomena, additive manufacturing techniques and biomedical applications, fundamental fluids and soft matter research, complex fluids and transport phenomena, scientific computing and computational fluid dynamics.
