I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering from [Brown University](http://www.brown.edu), where I was a member of Fluids and Thermal Sciences Group under the guidance of [Prof. Jesse Ault](https://sites.brown.edu/aultlab/). I was a Research Scientist Intern at [Tokyo Electron Limited](https://www.tel.com/) working on multiphysics simulation for single wafer wet etching processes. Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Iowa. Currently, I am a postdoctoral associate at Rice University under the guidance of [Prof. Yong Lin Kong](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/yong-lin-kong) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
